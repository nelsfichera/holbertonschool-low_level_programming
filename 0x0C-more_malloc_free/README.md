0. Write a function that allocates memory using malloc, returning a pointer to the allocated memory. On failure, this function should cause normal process termination with a status value of 98.
1. Write a function that concatenates two strings. The returned pointer shall point to newly allocated space containing s1, folloed by the first n bytes of s2 and null terminated. On failure, the function should return NULL. If n is greater or equal to the length of s2 then include the entire s2 string. If NULL is passed, it should be trated as an empty string. 
2. Write a function that allocates memory for an array using malloc. The calloc function allocates memory for an array nmemb elements of size bytes each and returns a pointer to the allocated memory. The memory is set to zero. If nmemb or size is 0 then calloc returns NULL. If malloc fails then calloc returns null. 
3. Write a funciton that creates an array of integers. The array created should contain all the values from min to max, ordered from min to max. Should return the pointer to the newly created array.
