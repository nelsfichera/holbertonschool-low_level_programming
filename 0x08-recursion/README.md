In this section, I'm learning how to use recursion. So I must perform the following tasks without the use of any loops 
or any of the standard library: 

0. Print a string followed by a new line.
1. Print a string in reverse.
2. Return the length of a string.
3. Return the factorial of a given number. 
4. Returns the value of x to the power of y. If y is less than 0, return -1.
5. Return the natural square root of a number. If n does not have a natural square root, return -1. 
6. Return 1 if the input is a prime number, else return 0. 
7. Return 1 if a string is a palindrome and 0 if not. An empty string is here defined as a palindrome.
8. Compare two strings and return 1 if considered identical, otherwise return 0.
